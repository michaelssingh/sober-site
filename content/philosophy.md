### Stability is a System.
At **SOBER**, we believe that engineering excellence is a byproduct of discipline. We apply the same rigor to our infrastructure that we apply to our lives.

**Our Pillars:**
1. **Compliant:** Governance by design.
2. **Composable:** Modular, versioned infrastructure.
3. **Cloud-agnostic:** Ownership of your technical destiny.
4. **Observable:** If it isn't measured, it doesn't exist.
